description: >-
  In this open-access chapter, Kevin Brooks and I analyze data from our Sugar Labs @ NDSU outreach program in response to the \"code year\" coding-crisis discourse. Our findings indicated that digital divides still exist and manifest in more complex ways than haves versus have-nots. We call for rhetoricians to engage more than the crisis tropes themselves, and ask others to become more involved in public efforts&mdash;efforts such as joining or creating multidisciplinary teams to develop more holistic curricula.
