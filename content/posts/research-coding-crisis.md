description: >-
  In this open-access chapter, Kevin Brooks and I analyze data from our Sugar
  Labs @ NDSU outreach program in response to the \"code year\" coding-crisis
  discourse. Our findings indicated that digital divides still exist and
  manifest in more complex ways than haves versus have-nots. We call for
  rhetoricians to engage more than the crisis tropes themselves, and ask others
  to become more involved in public efforts&mdash;efforts such as joining or
  creating multidisciplinary teams to develop more holistic curricula.
