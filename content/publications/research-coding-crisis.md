description: In this open-access chapter, Kevin Brooks and I analyze data from
  our Sugar Labs @ NDSU outreach program in response to the \"code year\"
  coding-crisis discourse. Our findings indicated that digital divides still
  exist and manifest in more complex ways than haves versus have-nots. We call
  for rhetoricians to engage more than the crisis tropes themselves, and ask
  others to become more involved in public efforts&mdash;efforts such as joining
  or creating multidisciplinary teams to develop more holistic curricula.
