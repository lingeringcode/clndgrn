description: >-
  Kevin Brooks, myself, and Matthew Warner propose six guiding principles for
  rhetoricians and digital humanists to engage the public sphere more
  comprehensively. Our principles are grounded in our three-year effort to build
  a \"smarter computing culture\" through an afterschool computational literacy
  curriculum. We integrate our experience with the tradition of rhetoric as an
  “architectonic productive art” (McKeon) and process of civic engagement. We
  aim to bridge digital humanities efforts with that of rhetoric to encourage
  more community-focused research.
