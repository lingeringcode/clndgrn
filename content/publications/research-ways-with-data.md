abstract: Coding has typically been understood as an engineering practice, where
  the meaning of code has discrete boundaries as a technology that does
  precisely what it says. Multidisciplinary code studies reframed this
  technological perspective by positing code as the latest form of writing,
  where code’s meaning is always partial and dependent on situational factors.
  Building out from this premise, this article theorizes coding as a form of
  writing with data through a qualitative case study of a web developer’s coding
  on a data-journalism team. I specifically theorize code as a form of
  intermediary writing to examine how his coding to process and analyze data
  sets involved the construction and negotiation of emergent problems throughout
  his coding tasks. Findings suggest how he integrated previous coding
  experience with an emerging sense of how code helped him write and revise the
  data. I conclude by considering the implications of these findings and discuss
  how writing and code studies could develop mutually informative approaches to
  coding as a situated and relational writing activity.
